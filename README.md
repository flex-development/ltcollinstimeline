On the night of May 19, 2017, two days away from graduation, 2nd Lieutenant's Richard Collins, a Bowie State University student, was stabbed to death on the University of Maryland's campus while waiting for his Uber. Two years later, former student Sean Urbanski is is awaiting trial on hate crime and murder charges in connection Collins' death, and is set is to go to trial July 22nd, 2019. Even prior to Collins' death, racial tensions have were high at the University, with several incidents tarnishing the University's reputation.

and promote an environment where students of all backgrounds feel safe and
accepted.
